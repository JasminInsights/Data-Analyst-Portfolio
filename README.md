# Jasmin Powell - Data Analyst Portfolio 
## ABOUT

Hi, I'm Jasmin! I am a passionate and driven professional with a background in clinical research and a deep interest in public health. With years of hands-on experience in the healthcare sector, I've developed a strong foundation in data analysis, research methodologies, and the importance of evidence-based decision-making. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Public Health to expand my expertise and further refine my skills in addressing health challenges on a larger scale.

In parallel with my academic journey, I am self-learning data analytics, focusing on tools like Python, R, SQL, and Tableau to complement my clinical research background. I am excited about the intersection of public health, data science, and technology, and am eager to apply data-driven insights to improve healthcare systems, optimize patient outcomes, and contribute to impactful public health initiatives.

With a commitment to continuous learning and a passion for making a difference, I am seeking opportunities to integrate my diverse skill set in clinical research, public health, and data analytics to help drive meaningful change in the healthcare industry.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

## Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie 

<b>Code:</b> [Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie.ipynb]()

<b>Goal:</b> To determine what factors contribute the most to a movie's success.

<b>Description:</b> The project focused on analyzing a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2022. The dataset included movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, gross earnings, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between budget and gross earnings, and implemented Pearson’s correlation statistical analysis.

<b>Skills:</b> data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

<b>Technology:</b> Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

<b>Results:</b> Using Python functions the analysis revealed that votes and budget have the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the company has no significant correlation.

## Tech Store Sales Analysis

<b>Goal:</b> To examine the sales history of the store and extract insights on its performance, as well as to identify potential improvements that can be implemented.

<b>Code:</b> [Tech Store Sales Analysis.ipynb]()

<b>Description:</b> The dataset contains a list of sales records. The records include the products for sale and order information(order id, order date, price, quantity ordered and purchase address). The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing sales data and hypothesis testing.

<b>Skills:</b> data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

<b>Technology:</b> Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.

<b>Results:</b>  Python functions that calculated and visually presented the sales data by month, city, and the most commonly sold items. Additionally, the reasons for the high frequency of these items being sold were analyzed and provided as insights.

## Nashville Housing Data Cleaning

<b>Code:</b> [Data Cleaning Project Queries: Nashville Housing.sql]()

<b>Description:</b> The dataset contains a list of houses that have been sold in Nashville between 2013 and 2019. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing.

<b>Skills:</b> DML(Data Manipulation Language), DQL (Data Query Language), DDL (Data Definition Language).

<b>Technology:</b> SQL Server

## Covid 19 Data Exploration

<b>Code:</b> [COVID Portfolio Project.sql]()

<b> Description:</b> The dataset contains records of Covid-19 cases, deaths and vaccine records by country in 2020-2021. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and EDA (exploratory data analysis).

<b>Skills:</b>  Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

<b>Technology:</b> SQL Server

## Legendary Pokémon Analysis

<b>Goal:</b> To predict Pokémon status based on their characteristics and rank their importance in determining whether a Pokémon is classified as legendary.

<b>Code:</b> [Legendary Pokémon Analysis (Study Project)]()

<b>Description:</b> The dataset contains a list of Pokémon. The records include their characteristics such as attack, defense, type and size. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing characteristics of different Pokémon.

<b>Skills:</b> data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

<b>Technology:</b> Tidyverse
